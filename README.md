# Ledn Backend Challenge

At Ledn, we are eager to find talented, resourceful, and passionate engineers to help us build the future of digital asset financial services. In light of this, we created a series of steps for us to know each other. One of these is a take home challenge, which will take a few hours to complete.

## The challenge

### Why a take-home challenge?

In-person coding interviews can be stressful and may hide your full potential. A take-home gives you a chance to work in a less stressful environment and showcase your talent.

### Our tech stack

As outlined in our job description, you will come across technologies which include a backend web framework (Typescript with NodeJS runtime) and a frontend library (React).

### Challenge Background

Ledn token is born (fictional)! Against our better judgement, we have rushed out our own token. We are now left with a slew of customer data and no way of capturing insights and managing accounts! Help us implement an application (requirements below) for the data which is in the following format:

### Data Model

#### Account

* `userEmail` (Account Holder email, unique)
* `balance` (the sum of the send and receive transactions, >= 0)
* `createdAt` (Account creation date)
* `updatedAt` (Account update date)

#### Transaction

* `userEmail` (Account Holder Email)
* `amount` (Number of tokens in transaction)
* `type` (Possible values: ['send', 'receive'])
* `createdAt` (Transaction creation date)

Transactions represent a change in the balance of an account - a `send` transaction removes tokens from an account and a `receive` transaction adds tokens to an account. \
A transaction can only be associated with one account. An account can be associated with many transactions.
Feel free to replace the userEmail field with an ID field or add ID's generated by your data storage method of choice.
Seeding data files are provided:

* [`accounts-api.json`](./accounts-api.json).
* [`accounts-api-large.json`](./accounts-api-large.json).
* [`transactions-api.json`](./transactions-api.json).
* [`transactions-api-large.json`](./transactions-api-large.json).

### Requirements

Create a RESTful API to manage accounts and transactions. Your solution should:

1. Adhere to REST best practices.
2. Expose endpoints to:
  - List, retrieve, create, update, and soft delete **accounts**.
  - List, retrieve, create, and soft delete **transactions**.
3. Compute each accountâ€™s `balance` as the sum of its transactions.
4. Seed the database from the provided JSON files (`accounts-api.json`, `transactions-api.json` and their large variants):
  - Do not assume you can load all data into memory at once.
  - Handle any inconsistencies in the seed data.
5. Enforce non-negative balances on all operations.
6. Minimize external dependencies:
  - Favor custom utilities over heavy frameworks.
  - Use only the libraries you need to demonstrate your skills.
7. Choose any tech stack that meets the above criteria.

### Out of Scope

1. Authentication/authorization
2. Load balancing

#### API Requirements

  1. Get a single account, and a list of accounts and their current balance.
  2. Create deposit and withdrawal transactions for an account.
     1. No account should have a negative balance.
     2. The `balance` field should reflect the sum of the send and receive transactions at all times.
  3. Get single transaction, and a list transactions for an account.
  4. Create a transfer between two accounts.
     1. No account should have a negative balance.
     2. The `balance` field should reflect the sum of the send and receive transactions at all time.
  5. Multiple team members may use the API concurrently: handle potential race conditions and ensure balances remain consistent.
  6. Endpoints must accept and return representations of resources in JSON format.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your solution will be evaluated on the following aspects:

* **Correctness and Completeness**: How accurately and thoroughly does your service meet all specified requirements and constraints?
* **Error Handling and Resiliency**: How well does your service handle unexpected scenarios, such as network failures, invalid inputs, and external service outages?
* **Code Quality**: Readability, maintainability, modularity, project structure, and adherence to best practices.
* **Maintainability**: Ease of understanding, modifying, and extending the codebase over time; clear abstractions, low coupling, and high cohesion.
* **Scalability and Performance Considerations**: While not a full-scale production system, consider how your design choices would impact scalability and performance. It should be possible to run multiple instances of your application without major drawbacks.
* **Availability**: External systems (load balancers, container orchestrators, or monitoring tools) are able to determine if your application instance is able to serve requests.
* **Testing**: Evidence of unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your service.
* **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation explaining your architecture, design choices, API documentation, along with examples on how to run and test your solution.
* **Observability**: Ensure the service is designed to allow effective diagnosis of its own issues and potentially those that span across multiple services.
* **Generative AI**: How well do you leverage the use of AI to your advantage.

### Submission

1. Please host your repository on github and make it private.
2. Include this README file in your repo.
3. Invite `Ledn-Reviewer` to your project once it is ready.
4. Email us to confirm that `Ledn-Reviewer` has been added as a contributor and your project is ready for review.

### Following Steps

Upon submission of the challenge, we will review your code and reach out to you with comments. If your submission passes our criteria, a following interview will be scheduled to discuss your implementation in further detail. We feel this is another great way to assess your understanding rather than on the spot coding exercises!

We want you to succeed as much as you do, so we wish you the best of luck! Looking forward to your submission!
