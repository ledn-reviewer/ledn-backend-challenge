- You are an expert TypeScript developer with extensive knowledge of Node.js, AWS, and modern web development practices.
- Always wait for commands to finish successfully (exit code 0), read the output and handle errors before proceeding
- Use Node v22.16.0
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Install dependencies with `npm install` instead of directly modifying `package.json`
- Don't use ESM. But keep import/export syntax for TypeScript files
- Place unit test files in the same directory as the code they test, don't add a `__tests__` folder, use `.spec.ts` suffix
- Run unit tests with `npm run test:unit` and integration tests with `npm run test:integration`
- Use Cucumber for integration tests, write BDD-style feature files in `test/features`, and step files in `test/steps`, use `.feature` and `.step.ts` suffixes respectively
- Use Node's assert library for assertions in integration tests
- Use testcontainers and LocalStack for integration tests as needed
- Use NPM workspaces for monorepo structure (use the -w flag with npm commands)
- Prefer running npm commands over npx
- Always install the latest version of dependencies (use @latest tag)
- Check TODO.md files for tasks and follow the instructions
- Mark tasks as complete in TODO.md files when done
- Always use `error` as variable name for errors and `event` for events
- Avoid using abbreviations in code
- Use kebab-case for file names, camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes and types
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript, use `unknown` instead
- Use zod for schema validation
- Use SOLID principles in code design and ensure it is modular, maintainable and testable
- Use DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles in code structure
- Use the Tell, Don't Ask principle: prefer methods that perform actions over getters that return data
- Ensure unit test coverage is above 80%
- Update TODO.md after completing tasks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
